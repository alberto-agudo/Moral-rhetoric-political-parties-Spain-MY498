# The (moral) Prince: Moral rhetoric in Spanish political videos and tweets

This repository contains both coding and data folders used to complete the MY498 Capstone project, written in completion of the MSc in Applied Social Data Science at the London School of Economics. The coding folder is organized numerically from the data collection phases (which are indexed as 0), MFD translation (1), and text analysis (2). On the other hand, the data folder is separated by clean and raw data.

*Note: The coding files rely on the downloaded audio files, which can be collected through the coding file 0.2. I have not uploaded them to the repository because of their large file size. Furthermore, each particular audio can be checked by using the link present in each tweet (with variable name `status_url`. If any researcher requires them, you can contact me at a.agudo99@hotmail.es*
